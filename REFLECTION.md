My predictions were accurate since they were based on the data itself, which did not change. I did not fully filter/test for any possible patterns, so it remains unclear if there are any. Though, given the small data sample size, I don't think there are any meaningful trends. 

I did not experiment with .reduce(), but I found .map() and .filter() to be very useful for pinpointing specific elements of the data that meet (or don't meet) a condition and then extracting/storing the desired results.
